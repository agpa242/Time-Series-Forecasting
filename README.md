# Time-Series-Forecasting

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post. We will demonstrate different approaches for forecasting retail sales time series. Letâ€™s get started!

The project entails a structured execution across five distinct stages:

  **Step 1: Data Pre-Processing**\\
  **Step 2: Data Visualization**\\
  **Step 3: Time Series analysis using ARIMA**
  **Step 4: Fitting the ARIMA model**
  **Step 5: Validating the Model**
