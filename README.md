# Time-Series-Forecasting

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post. We will demonstrate different approaches for forecasting retail sales time series. Letâ€™s get started!

## Project Stages

The project entails a structured execution across five distinct stages:

- **Step 1: Data Pre-Processing**
- **Step 2: Data Visualization**
- **Step 3: Time Series Analysis using ARIMA**
- **Step 4: Fitting the ARIMA Model**
- **Step 5: Validating the Model**

Each stage plays a crucial role in understanding, modeling, and validating time series data for accurate forecasting.

Remember, accurate time series forecasting can provide valuable insights into various domains. Follow the steps diligently to make informed predictions based on historical data.
